## OOP Workshop - Cosmetics shop 2

### Description

You are given a software system for managing a cosmetics shop. The system already has a working Engine. You do not have to touch anything in it. Just use it.

There should be two types of products for now, Shampoos and Toothpastes.

- Each Shampoo has **name, brand, price, gender, milliliters, usage**.
- Each Toothpaste has **name, brand, price, gender, ingredients**.

There are also Categories and Shopping Carts.

- Categories have a **name and a list of products**.
- Shopping Cart has a **list of products**.

### Task

Your task is to **design an object-oriented class hierarchy** to model the cosmetics shop, **using the best practices for object-oriented design** (OOD) and **object-oriented programming** (OOP). Encapsulate correctly all attributes and use validation whenever needed.


#### 1. Shampoo class

- Implements Shampoo
- Has a name, brand, price, gender, milliliters, and usage type
- The name’s length should be between 3 and 10 symbols.
- The brand name’s length should be between 2 and 10 symbols.
- The price cannot be negative.
- Gender type can be one of **"Men"**, **"Women"** or **"Unisex"**.
- Milliliters cannot be negative.
- Usage type can be one of **"Every_Day"** or **"Medical"**.

#### 2. ToothPaste class

- Implements Toothpaste.
- Has name, brand, price, gender, and ingredients.
- The name’s length should be between 3 and 10 symbols.
- The brand name’s length should be between 2 and 10 symbols.
- The price cannot be negative.
- Gender type can be one of **"Men"**, **"Women"** or **"Unisex"**.

#### 3. ApplicationData class

- Stores all the application's data.
- Handles creation of new objects.
- Used to find already existing objects.


### Constraints

- Look into the example below to get better understanding of the printing format.
- All floating-point numbers should be printed rounded to two decimal places.


### Additional notes

- To simplify your work you are given an already built execution engine that executes a sequence of commands read from the console using the classes in your project.
- If you decide to create and use new classes you are allowed to do so.
- When you implement an unfinished method (one that raise `NotImplementedError`), make sure to delete the `raises NotImplementedError` line.

### Unit Tests

You are given unit tests to keep track of your progress.

## Step by step guide

> *Hint*: You don't need to modify most of the functionality but of course you could try to understand how it works.

> *Hint*: Run the Unit tests whenever you finish a task.

1. Implement the classes for shampoo and toothpaste

- Look at the **models** folder and think about how to reuse functionality from Product class.
- In the `__init__`, pass the required fields to the super constructor and initialize those specific for the derived classes 
- Make sure validations are correct.
- Implement all the necessary properties. `Leave the to_string()` method for later.


2. Implement `CreateShampooCommand` and `CreateToothpasteCommand`.

- In the `execute` method, extract and parse the input parameters, and after that use them to create the Shampoo/Toothpaste.

> *Hint*: Look at `CreateCategoryCommand` if you get stuck.

3. Implement the unfinished methods in the `ApplicationData` class.

- This is where the creation of the objects should be.
- Add the newly created object to the list.

5. Implement the `to_string()` methods

**6. ADVANCED TASK**

- Implement new product and its creation in the engine class.
- Cream (name, brand, price, gender, scent)
  - name minimum 3 symbols and maximum 15
  - brand minimum 3 symbols and maximum 15
  - price greater than zero
  - gender (men, women, unisex)
  - scent (lavender, vanilla, rose)
- Implement product creation in the Factory and the ApplicationData
  - Just look at the other products
- Test it if it works correctly

### Input example

```none
CreateShampoo MyMan Trashy 10.99 Men 1000 Every_Day
CreateToothpaste White Expensive 10.99 Men calcium,fluorid
CreateCategory Shampoos
CreateCategory Toothpastes
AddToCategory Shampoos MyMan
AddToCategory Toothpastes White
AddToShoppingCart MyMan
AddToShoppingCart White
ShowCategory Shampoos
ShowCategory Toothpastes
TotalPrice
RemoveFromCategory Shampoos MyMan
ShowCategory Shampoos
RemoveFromShoppingCart MyMan
TotalPrice
End
```

### Output Example
